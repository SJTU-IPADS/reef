# REEF Resource

This directory contains the device code of some DNN models.

## Build

```
$ make transform
$ make build
```

## DNN Model

A DNN model that is loadable in REEF should contain three file:

1. GPU device code (model.cu)
2. Kernel schedule (model.json)
3. Model parameter (model.param, Optional)

All of the files can be generated by TVM (a customized version). (TODO)

Other files will be generated automatically, including:

1. GPU device code of RT tasks (model.trans.cu)
2. GPU device code of BE tasks (model.be.cu)
3. Kernel latency profile (model.profile.json)

## Example

See the `mocked_kernel` directory.
